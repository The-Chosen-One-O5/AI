# Changes Summary - Call Join/Leave Commands

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes made to implement the call join/leave commands ticket.

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED

The requested commands were **already fully implemented** in the codebase. Only two minor improvements were needed:
1. Add documentation to the help text
2. Fix Telethon API compatibility issue

## Changes Made to `main.py`

### 1. Help Text Update (Lines 2311-2314)
Added new "Call Commands" section:
```python
"**Call Commands** (Admin)\n"
"`/joincall` - Join the voice/video call\n"
"`/leavecall` - Leave the call\n"
"`/callinfo` - Show detailed call status and diagnostics\n\n"
```

### 2. Telethon API Compatibility Fixes

#### In `joincall_command()` function:
- Line 3142: `edit_text` → `edit`
- Line 3144: `edit_text` → `edit`
- Line 3151: `edit_text` → `edit`

#### In `leavecall_command()` function:
- Line 3173: `edit_text` → `edit`
- Line 3175: `edit_text` → `edit`
- Line 3179: `edit_text` → `edit`

3. Test `/joincall` and `/leavecall` in active voice chat
4. Test `/callinfo` shows correct status
